The Basic Stick

The Basic Stick is the perfect stick for beginners. The stick rotates slowly to provide
      extra time for performing stick tricks, but is flashy enough to impress your friends.


Patented Dura-Coat  finish ensures sticks can withstand all weather
conditions. More durable than other sticks, these props will keep looking like new for as long
          as you own them.

Enhanced stick flexibility provides more bounce, allowing for better tricks. A soft
rubber core adds a whole new element to the sticking experience that you have to feel to
believe!


Full customization will give you the chance to own a pair of sticks unlike any others
out there.  I make exactly what you want, with your colors and your designs.
A personal touch through both my customization options and hand-crafted designs.
