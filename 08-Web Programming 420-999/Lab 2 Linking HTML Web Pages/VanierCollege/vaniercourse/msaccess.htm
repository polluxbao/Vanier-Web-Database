    <h3>MS Access Course</h3>
    <p>Microsoft Access allows me to design and create a simple
        database for insurance data management.
        What is the difference between Exccel worksheet and Access?
        The main difference is organizing data into related tables for example:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Client table for storing insurance client information.</li>
        <li>insurance_products table for storing products offered by insurance company.</li>
        <li>Enrollment_client table for storing the payment made by clients.</li>
    </ol>
