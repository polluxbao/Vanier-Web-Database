	Question:	
	Letâ€™s write a program for a car agency called Vroom. 
	First, we have to see if the customer would like to
	buy or rent a car. 
	
	If the user wants to buy a car, the agency has three 
	different cars to offer. 
	A Toyota, a Ford, and a Ferrari. 
	The user can choose the car he/she wants and the program will end. 
	
	If the user wants to rent a car, he/she has to enter the number of 
	days he/she needs the car.
